# YouTube downloader

This repo contains a simple program for downloading YouTube videos and playlists.

To run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The menu is simple to navigate.

It automatically chooses the highest available resolution, but only handles progressive streams, so the maximum resolution is 720p.
